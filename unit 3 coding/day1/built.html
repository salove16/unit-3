    var array=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]



console.log(array.splice(1,1))    //output will be 1
console.log(array.slice(1,4))      // output will be 2,3,4 since index 1 is starting position and index 4 is ending
var str="123456"

// in Immutable if we try str[0]=3 it won't replace the value from 1 to 3 as its primetive data type  so we cant use this in immutable 


var arr=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]

arr[0]=66
console.log(arr)  // output =[66,1,2,3,4,5,6]
Object.freeze(arr)
arr[0]=0
console.log(arr) //output=[66,1,2,3,4,5,6]   in this case value doesnt changed as ithe array has been freezed so will get same output

var a=36
const b=36
a=2;
b=2;
console.log(a)
  // output will be a=2  

  console.log(b)// output  for b it will be Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. as the variable has been constant which cant be replace
